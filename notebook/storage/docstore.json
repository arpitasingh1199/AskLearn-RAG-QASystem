Machine learning, deep learning, and neural\r\nnetworks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually\r\na sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.\r\nThe way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm\r\nlearns. \"Deep\" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised\r\nlearning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The\r\ndeep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images),\r\nand it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different\r\ncategories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention\r\nrequired and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning\r\nas \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides\r\noutside ibm.com).\r\nClassical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to\r\nlearn.

Based on some input data, which can be labeled or\r\nunlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.\r\nAn Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If\r\nthere are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess\r\nthe accuracy of the model.\r\nA Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the\r\ntraining set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the\r\nknown example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative\r\n\u201cevaluate and optimize\u201d process, updating weights autonomously until a\r\nthreshold of accuracy has been met.\r\nMachine learning methods\r\nMachine learning models fall into three primary categories.\r\nSupervised machine learning\r\nSupervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use\r\nof labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.\r\nAs input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted\r\nappropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the\r\nmodel avoids overfitting or underfitting.

A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to\r\nvalidate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more\r\nunstable than other decision predictors.\r\nOverall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage\r\nfor new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in\r\nmassive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires\r\nlittle human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning\r\nsystem assemble and refine its own algorithms\u2014which will continually improve with\r\nmore data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized\r\nexperience as the model learns more with every experience with that person.\r\nOn the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate\r\nand unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering\r\nsufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on\r\nresources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With\r\ntoo small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is\r\ncompletely wrong or misleading. To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers,\r\norganizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the\r\noutput.\r\nReal-world machine learning use cases\r\nHere are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day:\r\nSpeech recognition: It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer\r\nspeech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language\r\nprocessing (NLP) to translate human speech into a written format. Many mobile devices\r\nincorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search\u2014e.g. Siri\u2014or\r\nimprove accessibility for texting.\r\nCustomer service: Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer\r\njourney, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and\r\nsocial media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about\r\ntopics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or\r\nsuggesting sizes for users. Examples include virtual agents on e-commerce sites;\r\nmessaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by\r\nvirtual assistants and voice assistants.\r\nComputer vision: This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful\r\ninformation from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the\r\nappropriate action.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9450, "end_char_idx": 13308, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8912b61f-304a-4012-bb25-dba5afecc747": {"__data__": {"id_": "8912b61f-304a-4012-bb25-dba5afecc747", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "306611ba-faa2-448a-8385-7d6f6f57feac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "hash": "8986b06c874a37513862a8558b58901bce88c5549682949106ef50cce8df7eb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "326ac47c-7e98-48cb-8e99-c27771e6d86c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "hash": "2eb93a6afeaa8e3a3856611c2b124a32b7a191c97aba24c30192917f452c1182", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc6d9f2e-a4c6-4e88-bacd-3267fb9a580f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5bfafd62119ea78d64c7dbf2978c5f1a0ffb52d8174b9812bec5b74805a1525", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Siri\u2014or\r\nimprove accessibility for texting.\r\nCustomer service: Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer\r\njourney, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and\r\nsocial media platforms.

Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has\r\napplications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and\r\nself-driving cars in the automotive industry.\r\nRecommendation engines: Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can\r\nhelp to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling\r\nstrategies.

Supervised learning can train a model using information about\r\nknown fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look\r\natypical and deserve further investigation.\r\nChallenges of machine learning\r\nAs machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier.\r\nHowever, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of\r\nethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include:\r\nTechnological singularity\r\nWhile this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned\r\nwith the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological\r\nsingularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick\r\nBostrum defines superintelligence as \u201cany intellect that vastly outperforms the best\r\nhuman brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom,\r\nand social skills.\u201d Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the\r\nidea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous\r\nsystems, like self-driving cars. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never\r\nhave an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should\r\nwe still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to\r\nsemi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this,\r\nbut these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI\r\ntechnology develops.\r\nAI impact on jobs\r\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this\r\nconcern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see\r\nthat the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the\r\nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric\r\nvehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn\u2019t going away,\r\nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\r\nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There\r\nwill need to be individuals to help manage AI systems.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12552, "end_char_idx": 16509, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc6d9f2e-a4c6-4e88-bacd-3267fb9a580f": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc6d9f2e-a4c6-4e88-bacd-3267fb9a580f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "306611ba-faa2-448a-8385-7d6f6f57feac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "hash": "8986b06c874a37513862a8558b58901bce88c5549682949106ef50cce8df7eb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8912b61f-304a-4012-bb25-dba5afecc747", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "hash": "b12d9dac32f006d400b2d3a92b011e24e5365a03a8a80402a246b923cf57e7a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8521849a-78b3-4d7c-8746-2ed47d57a14e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "896b6c6c3d12946afa71e8c67e93cb4e9e0b50ff05598bd947f871c6df412ad5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "AI impact on jobs\r\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this\r\nconcern should probably be reframed.

There\r\nwill need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people\r\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\r\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with\r\nartificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition\r\nto new roles that are in demand.\r\nPrivacy\r\nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data\r\nsecurity. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent\r\nyears. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data\r\nof people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more\r\ncontrol of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such\r\nas the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and\r\nrequires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation\r\nsuch as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally\r\nidentifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an\r\nincreasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and\r\nopportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\r\nBias and discrimination\r\nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have\r\nraised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we\r\nsafeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be\r\ngenerated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good\r\nintentions for their automation efforts, Reuters (link resides outside ibm.com) highlights\r\nsome of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their\r\neffort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against\r\njob candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap\r\nthe project. Harvard Business Review (link resides outside ibm.com) has raised other\r\npointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should\r\nbe able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role.\r\nBias and discrimination aren\u2019t limited to the human resources function either; they can\r\nbe found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media\r\nalgorithms.\r\nAs businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they\u2019ve also become more\r\nactive in this discussion around AI ethics and values. For example, IBM has sunset its\r\ngeneral purpose facial recognition and analysis products. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna\r\nwrote: \u201cIBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial\r\nrecognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling,\r\nviolations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent\r\nwith our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.\u201d\r\nAccountability\r\nSince there isn\u2019t significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real\r\nenforcement mechanism to ensure that ethical AI is practiced.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15821, "end_char_idx": 19644, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8521849a-78b3-4d7c-8746-2ed47d57a14e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8521849a-78b3-4d7c-8746-2ed47d57a14e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "306611ba-faa2-448a-8385-7d6f6f57feac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "hash": "8986b06c874a37513862a8558b58901bce88c5549682949106ef50cce8df7eb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc6d9f2e-a4c6-4e88-bacd-3267fb9a580f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\qasystem\\notebook\\..\\Data\\MLDoc.txt", "file_name": "MLDoc.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-10"}, "hash": "897d1e2e04a8a9cd1bbf82e6c916abd980d7ae932511007dcd2b574a6438a317", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they\u2019ve also become more\r\nactive in this discussion around AI ethics and values.

To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration\r\nbetween ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI\r\nmodels within society. However, at the moment, these only serve to guide.

When reviewing multiple\r\nvendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features =\r\na better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI\r\nplatform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to\r\nbe delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature\r\nmight doom the usefulness of an entire system. Here are some features to consider.\r\nMLOps capabilities. Does the system have:\r\na unified interface for ease of management?\r\nautomated machine learning tools for faster model creation with low-code\r\nand no-code functionality?\r\ndecision optimization to streamline the selection and deployment of\r\noptimization models?\r\nvisual modeling to combine visual data science with open-source libraries\r\nand notebook-based interfaces on a unified data and AI studio?\r\nautomated development for beginners to get started quickly and more\r\nadvanced data scientists to experiment?\r\nsynthetic data generator as an alternative or supplement to real-world data\r\nwhen real-world data is not readily available?\r\nGenerative AI capabilities.
